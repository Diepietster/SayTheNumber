# Say The Number

This program when executed takes the passed in parameter values in the SayNumber method and returns that number in words. 

## Logic of the program

Basically the string gets broken into **three** digit parts.
- Every part of the digit is being dealt with individually 
- Because this is a recursive method, it is possible to break down and deal with the number one digit at a time. 

## Punctuation

The trim() and substring() methods is being used to take care of the punctuation.
